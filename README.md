# Smart Obstacle-Avoiding Car üèéÔ∏è

## Overview
This project demonstrates a cost-effective, autonomous, obstacle-avoiding car using an ESP32 microcontroller. The vehicle detects obstacles using ultrasonic sensors and adjusts its path accordingly using an H-bridge motor driver. This simple yet effective model showcases the fundamental principles of autonomous navigation.

## Features
- **Autonomous Navigation**: Uses ultrasonic sensors to detect obstacles and avoid collisions.
- **ESP32-Based Control**: Efficiently processes sensor data and controls motor movement.
- **H-Bridge Motor Driver**: Manages motor direction and speed.
- **Compact and Cost-Effective**: Designed with affordability and simplicity in mind.

## Components Used
- ESP32 Microcontroller
- Ultrasonic Sensors
- H-Bridge Motor Driver
- DC Motors and Tires
- Chassis
- Power Supply (Battery)

## Working Principle
1. **Obstacle Detection**: The ultrasonic sensors measure distances by sending out sound waves and analyzing the time taken for the echo to return.
2. **Decision Making**: The ESP32 processes sensor data to determine the next movement.
3. **Motor Control**: Based on sensor input, the H-bridge driver controls the motors to move forward, stop, or turn.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Hardware Assembly**: Mount all components onto the chassis, ensuring secure connections.
2. **Programming**: Write and upload the code to the ESP32 using the Arduino IDE.
3. **Testing & Adjustments**: Fine-tune sensor sensitivity and motor speed for optimal performance.

## Future Enhancements
- **GPS Integration**: Enable path following and waypoint navigation.
- **AI Integration**: Implement machine learning for better decision-making.
- **Advanced Sensors**: Add cameras and LiDAR for improved obstacle detection.
- **IoT Connectivity**: Remote control via the internet.
